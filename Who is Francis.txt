Hi!

My name is Francis, I am a licensed electronics engineer and currently teaching Research, Science, and Computer Technology subjects in senior high school.

I love exploring new sceneries that's why I often travel with my girlfriend.
I enjoy learning new things to better myself not only professionally but also my intra and interpersonal skills.

I look forward to gain knowledge in this Front-End Development Bootcamp as I am very interested in shifting to an IT Career.

Thank you!
